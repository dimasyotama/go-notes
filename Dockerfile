# Note here: To avoid downloading dependencies every time we
# build image. Here, we are caching all the dependencies by
# first copying go.mod and go.sum files and downloading them,
# to be used every time we build the image if the dependencies
# are not changed.

# Copy go mod, go sum and .env files
COPY go.mod ./
COPY go.sum ./
COPY .env ./

# Download all dependencies.
RUN go mod download

# Now, copy the source code

# It is also a common best practise.
